Ishuah Kariuki is a software engineer and SRE. He graduated from Kenyatta University in 2011 with a BS in Computer Science. He has worked as a software engineer in the Kenyan startup scene.

Ishuah prefers the short form moniker "Ish" when he's out and about being an untenable troublemaker. He's available for any activity that involves laughter and adrenaline.
Ish is tired of refering to himself in the third person.
You can follow his shenanigans on Twitter @ishuah\_ or contact him by email on kariuki@ishuah.com.
